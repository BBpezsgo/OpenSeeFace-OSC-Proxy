Originally I used [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace) for face tracking, but now I gathered some random Python scripts from other people. I will see where this will go.

So the face tracking works in Python because I don't have the nerves to implement it in c#.
I hate Python so I wrote a proxy in c# that receives the face tracking data and sends it to VRChat over OSC.
